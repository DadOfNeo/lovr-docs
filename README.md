lovr-docs
===

This repository contains the documentation for [LÖVR](https://github.com/bjornbytes/lovr).

There are three main types of documentation here:

- The **`api`** folder contains a Lua table with metadata for all LÖVR functions and objects.
  - This is used to generate documentation, but is also useful for integrating with other tools
  (e.g. autocomplete for the LÖVR API in text editors).
  - Each function, object, etc. has a Lua file that exports its metadata.  These are aggregated
  into a single table stored in `init.lua`.  The aggregator is a LÖVR script, you can run it by
  typing `lovr api` at the root of this repository.
- The **`examples`** folder contains sample LÖVR projects and tutorials.
  - The ones listed in the `init.lua` file are shown on the website.
  - All the code in the examples is released under CC0.  However, the models, textures, sounds, and
  other assets used may use different licensing, so be sure to double check those.
- The **`guides`** folder contains markdown files that explain LÖVR-related concepts in depth.
  - Similarly, `init.lua` contains a manifest used to populate the sidebar on the website.

Note that each release of LÖVR has its own branch.  Cherry picks are used to propagate fixes to
relevant branches as needed.  Which will totally scale.
