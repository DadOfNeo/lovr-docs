    Creates and returns a Pass object, which is used to record commands for the GPU.  Commands can
    be recorded by calling functions on the Pass.  After recording a set of passes, they can be
    submitted for the GPU to process using `lovr.graphics.submit`.

    Pass objects are **temporary** and only exist for a single frame.  Once `lovr.graphics.submit`
    is called, any passes that were created during that frame become **invalid**.  Each frame, a new
    set of passes must be created and recorded. LÖVR tries to detect if you use a pass after it's
    invalid, but this error checking is not 100% accurate at the moment.

    There are 3 types of passes.  Each type can record a specific type of command:

    - `render` passes render graphics to textures.  The `lovr.draw` callback receives a render pass
      as an argument.
    - `compute` passes run compute shaders.
    - `transfer` passes can transfer data to/from GPU objects, like `Buffer` and `Texture`.

    Fun facts about render passes:

    - Textures must have the same dimensions, layer counts, and sample counts.
    - Textures must have been created with the `render` `TextureUsage`.
    - If `mipmap` is true, then any textures with mipmaps must have the `transfer` `TextureUsage`.
    - It's okay to have zero color textures, but in this case there must be a depth texture.
    - Setting `clear` to `false` for textures is usually very slow on mobile GPUs.

    For `compute` and `transfer` passes, all of the commands in the pass act as though they run in
    parallel.  This means that writing to the same element of a buffer twice, or writing to it and
    reading from it again is not guaranteed to work properly on all GPUs.  LÖVR is not currently
    able to check for this.  If compute or transfers need to be sequenced, multiple passes should be
    used.  It is, however, completely fine to read and write to non-overlapping regions of the same
    buffer or texture.
