  description = [[
    A TextureData stores raw 2D pixel info for `Texture`s.  It has a width, height, and format.  The
    TextureData can be initialized with the contents of an image file or it can be created with
    uninitialized contents.  The supported image formats are `png`, `jpg`, `hdr`, and `dds`.

    Usually you can just use Textures, but TextureData can be useful if you want to manipulate
    individual pixels or load Textures in a background thread.
