Frequently asked questions.

> Can I use LÖVR without a VR headset?

Yes, LÖVR will automatically use a fake headset system that you can control with your keyboard/mouse
if there isn't any VR hardware detected.

You can also set the `t.modules.headset` flag to false in
`lovr.conf` to disable VR completely and develop a traditional 3D desktop application.

> Does LÖVR work with mobile devices (Cardboard, Gear VR, Oculus Go, etc.)?

There isn't official support for mobile hardware yet.  However, you can run projects in a browser
using WebVR and those will usually work on mobile devices.  An Android port is also in progress but
isn't available yet.

> Are there macOS binaries available?

Yes, you can download them from <https://lovr.org/download/mac>.

> Is there any way to access keyboard/mouse input?

Yes, see `lovr-keyboard` and `lovr-mouse` on the <a data-key="Libraries">Libraries</a> page.

> Does LÖVR work on Linux?

Sorta.  Linux is an officially supported platform and generally works okay, but I don't test on
Linux very often so you may encounter problems.  If you do run into something, please open an issue
or post in Slack about it.
